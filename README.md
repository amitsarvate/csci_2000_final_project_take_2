### Introduction

In this repository, we will be examining the Airbnb data in New York City. The dataset was gathered from Kaggle (Dgomonov, 2019). It contains several key columns – we took data pertaining to the price of the room, geographic location (using latitude and longitude), number of reviews placed online, borough within New York City, and the neighbourhood within each borough. These were presented as a mixture of numerical and categorical data. We believe that this report is absolutely essential since now that COVID-19 restrictions are beginning to lift, and many people are looking to travel abroad in a return to pre-COVID normalcy. Many returning travellers may be interested in finding the best Airbnb to rent, to avoid high costs of hotels (and potential COVID-19 superspreaders in large hotels). Being able to rent a private Airbnb may be of interest to many sceptical travellers, concerned about the potential of catching the novel coronavirus. 

Additionally, the current real estate market may compel potential investors to look into the acquisition of new properties for use as Airbnb units. It may be advantageous for many investors to look into optimal properties, locations, and pricing, to gain traffic to their properties. This will also be discovered throughout the analysis performed herein.

### Discussion

Throughout the data analysis performed in Python, we’ve found several key findings. We’ve found that Manhattan and Brooklyn have the greatest number of Airbnb’s available for rental. Collectively, these two boroughs account for It appears that Staten Island has a dearth of Airbnb properties, only accounting for 1% of the total properties in New York City. Further analysis would be required to determine if this is a market opening, or if the lack of Airbnb’s is due to a lack of consumer interest.  

We’ve also found that renters might be compelled to purchase properties on the coastal areas, especially within Manhattan. This is because there appears to be a larger number of reviews posted from coastal properties than from inland properties. It should be noted that the number of reviews is not directly equivalent to the number of customers using the property, although they can be assumed to be correlated with one another. This is a drawback to our approach and further analysis would be required to determine with certainty the validity.

Continuing with this notion of using number of reviews as a proxy for popularity of a property, we have mapped the correlation between price and number of reviews (and hence popularity). We’ve found that, unsurprisingly, lower-priced properties have higher traffic. The graph approaches an inverse function, and as such, finding the inflection point would be advantageous to determine the ideal rate to charge for a property in a specific borough/neighbourhood. 

The two areas with the highest price are in Manhattan, and are located directly south of Central Park, and in the Financial District (along the southern tip of the Manhattan Peninsula). As such, travelers might be advised to find an Airbnb in the Greenwich Village and SoHo areas. Renters may be able to capitalize on this desire to find proximate accomodation to these two central locations in Manhattan, by situating their Airbnb properties in the Greenwich Village and SoHo neighbourhoods, in between Central Park and the Financial District. 

There appear to be niche, high-priced properties in Staten Island, although the traffic appears to be lower. As such, the returns may diminish. However, each night’s stay will be of a higher value.

It also appears that Queen’s offers travelers with the most consistently affordable rates, providing that the traveler is willing to pay the costs of transportation to travel to their final destination (perhaps Manhattan). 

The offerings in Manhattan appear to be approximately evenly distributed across price, such that an equal number of low-, middle-, and high-priced properties are available to access. The price could directly correlate to the location within Manhattan, or it could potentially correlate to specifics of the offering (perhaps number of rooms, level of decor, etc.). 

### Conclusion

There are many suggestions that we have provided for potential buyers of properties to list on Airbnb. They should select a property in Manhattan or Brooklyn, near the coast, and select an mid-range price. Queens appears to be a poor location to select for a new rental property on Airbnb, as it locks the owner into a set price range consistent with their neighbours. Thus, improvements and renovations done to the property will not be reflected in the price – investors will not see a return in these investments. Staten Island Airbnb properties may be ideal for investors who seek large returns, but are fine with the property being vacant for time periods throughout the year. If acquiring a rental property for Airbnb in Manhattan, the neighbourhoods of Greenwich Village and SoHo are ideal candidates. 

Comparatively, we have made several recommendations for travellers. It may be ideal to rent a property in the Greenwich Village or SoHo neighbourhoods of New York City (if your final destination is Central Park or the Financial District) and commuting. Queens may be an ideal location for a traveller who is willing to commute greater distances to get to their destinations, as it is consistently low-priced, and there are very few outliers. This means that a prospective tenant may be able to secure a higher-valued property (with greater niceties and luxuries) at a much lower price. 

All in all, this dataset has proven extremely interesting, and has provided key insights for both Airbnb owners and travelers alike.
